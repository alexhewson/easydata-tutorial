    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, if someone else is trying to reproduce our work in any way, there must be a reason for it. Help them out. Make it easy for them to get to the point. We want reproducible results. So get to the results and help them to shine through the noice of all the technical details needed to get there. \n",
    "\n",
    "How many times do we say things like: X is my priority, and then give all of our time, energy, thought and resources to Y instead of X?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're all guilty of this at times with our code bases. If our results are the point of our work, why do we obscure the results by filling notebooks with utility and helper functions, code for munging the data, and otherwise exposing the gory guts of our methods to someone who just wants to get the point of the results and how we got there? Yes, please, include everything that's needed to get to the results, that's what we're after, reproducibility. But how do we keep things reproducible without making the through-line impossible to find?\n",

    "## Reproducibility Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "* (THE-KITCHEN-SINK): Code and prose are mixed in a monolithic notebook. Utility scripts are mixed into the main narrative. Everything's in that notebook, including the kitchen sink.\n",
    "* (TL;DR): Documentation and/or code is too long and confusing. Get to the point. Every joke needs a punch line. Every story needs a climax. Every repo needs a raison d'etre.\n",
    "* (HARD-TO-FOLLOW): Everything is technically there. But it's hard to figure out how to piece it all together. What needs to be run first? What order do things need to be run in? Is it a quest to figure out the next step?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default Better Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Keep the prose close to the code**: Keep the explanation of what something does right next to it. \n",
    "    * **Tell stories with Jupyter Notebooks**: Interweave code and prose using Notebooks. They are fantastic for this purpose.\n",
    "* **Cut-cut-cut. Iterate.**: Remove everything that's not essential to the story. Put helper and utility functions in modules. Ruthlessly take code out of your notebooks and put it into modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Easydata Way: the editable `src` module\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how Easydata can help with these principles, let's take a look at the editable `src` module. We've been using this all along. But here's the deal, you can edit something in the `src` module, and have it automagically change here, in the notebook. Let's see this work in practice.\n"
